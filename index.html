          <h2>Water Fountain Simulation</h2>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp For my first particle system, I decided to simulate an arc of water
             pouring out of the top of a fountain. I downloaded a 3d asset of the fountain
             online and used a particle system with water textured particles to simulate the water.
             Each particle was given a negative initial y velocity within a random range, and a
             positive initial x velocity within a random range. There was also a small z velocity given
             to each particle to simulate the idea of randomness and potential wind hitting the fountain.
             One problem that I ran into while creating this particle system was the use of the Sphere() function
             with many particles being added to the ArrayList. The issue was that Sphere() uses many triangles
             to create one sphere. This is far too many calculations to run with thousands of particles within the system.
             To account for this computational limitation, I created a primitive 3d shape, with far fewer triangles than the
             Sphere() function would call. <br>
           &nbsp&nbsp The video to the right shows the simulation in action. It shows the 3d navigatable, user-controlled camera of the scene. At 1:20, the
           video zooms in to show the particles from close up. Below are a few screenshots from the simulation, highlighting some of the key features.</p>

          <h4>Collision Detection</h4>
          <p>   &nbsp&nbsp One of the more difficult aspects of this simulation was creating a collision detection mechanism with the 3d fountain.
              In the simulation, you can see that at each level of the fountain, the water particles pool in the bowl and eventually pour out
              in a realistic fashion. Once the particles hit the floor of the simulation they bounce up in a splashing animation. The
              photo below diagrams at which points in the model the water particles detect collisions, and react accordingly.</p>
